Task 1️⃣: Implement "Lifting State Up"
🔹 Create a Parent (App.js) that manages a count.
🔹 Pass the count to two children:

IncrementButton → Increases count
DecrementButton → Decreases count
🔹 The count updates in both children & parent when changed.

🚦 Steps to Follow:
Create a new state variable for the step value.
Add an input field to update the step value dynamically.
Modify the onClick handlers of buttons to use the step value instead of +1 or -1.

🔹 Next Task:
Add a Reset Button

A button that resets the count to zero and the stepValue to 1 when clicked.
Disable Increment & Decrement When Count is Zero & Step is Negative

Prevent the user from decrementing below zero.
If stepValue is negative, disable the increment button (to prevent increasing in the wrong direction).

Task:
✅ Disable the Increment Button when stepValue is Negative.
✅ Show a Warning Message when stepValue is Negative.

📌 Enhance Reset Button Functionality

When the Reset Button is clicked, reset:
count to 0 (already done ✅).
stepValue to an empty string "" (new 🆕).
action to 1 (new 🆕).
This ensures everything resets properly. Try implementing this now! 🚀
