Next Task:
ðŸ‘‰ Try implementing useEffect with dependencies.
Example: Show a message every time a user enters a new name in an input field.

Let me know once youâ€™ve tried it! ðŸš€

Great! Here's a challenge for you:

Task 1: Multiple useEffect Hooks
Create a component with two pieces of state: count and name.
Use two separate useEffect hooks:
One that runs when count changes.
One that runs when name changes.
Task 2: Skip First Render
Create a component that has an input field for a text state.
Use useRef to skip the effect on the first render, and log the text value only after it changes.
Task 3: Re-fetch Data on State Change
Create a component that fetches users' data from jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users.
Use an input field to search by user name, and fetch new data whenever the search query updates.
